# What is PHP?
- The language that WordPress is written in
- HTML just shows exactly what developers type, php, however, has a brain. It is a legitimate programming language.
- PHP is a server side language. All PHP runs in the server. Only the result of that code, not the code itself, gets sent to the visitors of our website.
