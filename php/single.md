# single.php

It’s good sense to build as simply as possible in your template structure and not make more templates unless you have real need for them. Therefore, most theme developers don’t create a single-post.php file because single.php is specific enough. For the most part, all themes should have a `single.php`. Below is an example of a `single.php` file from the theme Twenty Fifteen.
