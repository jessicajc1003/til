# How to push code to github 
0. Make sure your current working directory is where you want to push code to github. To check: `pwd`
1. To check the current git status: `git status`
2. To tell git to add **all** the files that have been changed to github: `git add -A`
3. To add some notes about what you are pushing: `git commit -m "write your message here"`
4. To push your codes to your github: `git push` 
-> You can see we just tell git bash to push, without telling where to put it. That's because the code you copied and pasted from GitHub previously already links your repository.
